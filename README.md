# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Predictor â€“ Streamlit App (Colab Compatible)

This project is a machine learning-based churn prediction system that allows users to input customer details and receive real-time churn predictions via a Streamlit web interface.

It runs entirely in **Google Colab**, with deployment handled via **ngrok**, so no setup is needed on your local machine.
